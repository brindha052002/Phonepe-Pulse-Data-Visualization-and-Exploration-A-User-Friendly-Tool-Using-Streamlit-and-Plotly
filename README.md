# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly

 # PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.



LIBRARIES/ MODULES 
1. Ploty
2. pandas
3. mysql.connector
4. streamlit
5. json
6. git.repo.base

# WORKFLOW

# 1. Data extraction: 
Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV
or JSON.

# 2. Data transformation: 
Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

# 3. Database insertion: 
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

# 4. Dashboard creation: 
Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

# 5. Data retrieval: 
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in
the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

# 6. Deployment: 
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it
accessible to users.
